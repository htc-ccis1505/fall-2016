# Tools
You're learning to be a true IT professional, and to do this, you must learn to work with real tools:

- the command line, terminal, or shell
- a professional text editor
- source code management
- a programming language and interpreter

### The shell
As a typical computer user, you interact with a graphical view of the system presented by your operating system.  However, underneath this is more direct and barebones interface to your operating system, the shell.  The shell allows us to navigate files, alter permissions, execute system tasks, and build and run the programs we will be developing. On a Windows computer this is PowerShell. On an Apple computer, it's Terminal. Generically it is called the shell. The shell is the IT professional's lifeblood; embrace it. The sooner you get comfortable with it, the easier your IT life will be.

### Programming Editor
You'll also need a text editor, something like MS Word for programming.  A good programming editor includes tools that make writing code easier, things like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and indenting blocks of text.  The editor recommended for this course is called [Atom](https://atom.io/), and it was made by the people at GitHub. It is one of the most popular, extensible and powerful text editors ever created.

The core of Atom is a basic text editor with some code smart features.  To make our lives easier in this course, we will extend it with some add-ons specific to the work that we will be doing.  As you learn to work with Atom, feel free to look for additional extensions to suit your own personal likes and needs.

### File & Version Management
Configuration files and code are important assets to an organization. Likewise the files you create as part of this course are important assets to you. We will be learning to manage these files professionally using a source code management tool called git which maintains versions of files inside of a repository and [GitHub](https://github.com/) a free, public cloud hosting service for your git repositories.

### Programming Language Tools
A programming language is a set of rules for how to express instructions to a computer. Examples include Ruby, Python, Javascript, and C#. Programming languages make it easy for us to express our program's intent in a way that is readable by people, but that text based code is not something that computers can understand.  Programming languages provide tools to translate the human readable text into the binary 1's and 0's that computers understand. This process is required before the computer can "run" our code.
