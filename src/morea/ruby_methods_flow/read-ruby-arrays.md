# {{ page.title }}
Read through Chapter 8 in the printed textbook, or Chapter 7 in the online [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_07.html), which covers how to work with arrays (lists of things) in Ruby.

As you read through the text, make sure you are sitting at your computer and trying the commands in interactive ruby from the shell.  

## Review Questions

- How would you display the first item in an array?
- How would you make an empty array?
- If you don't put something in an array slot, what value is there by default?
- Make an array of 5 words, then:  
  1. Use a `while` loop to display each word, one at a time.
  2. Use the array each method to display each word one at a time.
  3. Join the list of words into a sentence with a space in between each word.
  4. Extra: Capitalize the first letter and put a period at the end.
- How do you know how many items are in an array?
- How do you add and remove items from an existing array?

## Try it!
Do the practice exercises from the end of the chapter.

Use Ruby to:

- Write the program we talked about at the very beginning of this chapter. The one that let's you type in as many words as we want (one per line, continuing until we just press enter on an empty line) and then repeats the words back in alphabetical order. Hint: There's a lovely array method which will give you a sorted version of an array:  sort. Use it!
- Try writing the above program without using the sort method. A large part of programming is solving problems, so get all the practice you can! Hint: Try to do this with scraps of paper first so that you can break it down into programable steps.
