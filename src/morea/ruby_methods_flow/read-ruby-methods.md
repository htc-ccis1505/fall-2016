# {{ page.title }}
Read through Chapter 9 in the printed textbook, or Chapter 8 in the online [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_03.html), which covers how to make your own methods in Ruby.

As you read through the text, make sure you are sitting at your computer and trying the commands in interactive ruby from the shell.  

## Notes
Remember to use descriptive names for your methods and their input variables, but also remember that you cannot use spaces in these names.


## Review Questions

- How do you make a custom method in Ruby?
- How do you give it input values?
- What does it mean for a method to return a value?
- Do all methods have to return a value?
- What does it mean to be a local variable?

## Try It!

- Write a method to translate an integer into a "classic" Roman numeral.  (Classic means you don't have to deal with IV being 4. Only IIII would be 4.)
- Write a method to translate an integer into a "modern" Roman numeral.  (Now you've got to deal with IV being 4.)
