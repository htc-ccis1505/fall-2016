# Ruby Numbers
Read through Chapter 2 in the printed textbook, or Chapter 1 in the online [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_01.html), which covers how to write output in Ruby and work with numbers.

As you read through the text, make sure you are sitting at your computer and trying the commands in interactive ruby from the shell.  You run interactive ruby by using the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ irb
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that your shell prompt looks different when you are running irb.  

You can get out of the interactive ruby by entering in `exit`.

## Review Questions

- What is the difference between an integer and a float?
- How do you multiply two numbers in ruby?
- How do you divide one number by another?
- Why is 9/2 in ruby 4 and not 4.5?  What would you need to do to get 4.5?

## Try it!
Do the practice exercises from the end of the chapter.

Use Ruby to:

- Calculate how many hours are in a year
- Calculate how many minutes are in a decade (10 years)
- Calculate your age in seconds
- Determine the age, in years, of someone who is 1246 million (1,246,000,000) seconds old
