# {{ page.title }}
Read through Chapter 4 in the printed textbook, or Chapter 3 in the online [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_03.html), which covers how to use variables in Ruby.

As you read through the text, make sure you are sitting at your computer and trying the commands in interactive ruby from the shell.  

## Notes
Remember to use descriptive variable names.  In Ruby, you cannot have spaces in your variable names. Instead, the commonly used practice is to use an _ in place of a space.  For example a variable in a Ruby program might be called `my_name`.


## Review Questions

- What is a variable and why are they used?
- Is there any difference between a variable that holds a number and one that holds a string?
- Can a variable that was used to hold a number be changed to hold a string?
- Why does the following code display the word name and not Mary?
{% highlight ruby %}
var name = "Mary"
puts "name"
{% endhighlight %}
