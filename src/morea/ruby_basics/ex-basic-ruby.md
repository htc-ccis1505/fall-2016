# Simple Conversation in Ruby
We're going to write a script to have a simple conversation in Ruby.  

## Prerequisits
The following topics were covered earlier:

- [Install Git]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/ex-install-git.html ): To complete this exercise, you need to have git installed.  
- [Install Ruby]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/ex-install-ruby.html ): To complete this exercise, you must have ruby installed.
- Install [Atom](https://atom.io/): You should use Atom (or another programming editor) to edit the files.  
- [Shell Basics]( {{ site.baseurl }}/morea/intro/r2-shell-basics.html ): I will assume that you know how to access the appropriate shell for your OS that is able to execute git commands.

## Starter files from GitHub
Use the following link to create your own repository to submit the assignment on GitHub:
[Ruby Lab 1](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/af8e1933e70e3b8874dc010a630fdc26)

Click the link to have the assignment created for you, then click the link to go to your personal assignment repository on GitHub.

To complete the assignment, you will need to clone the repository to your computer, make changes to the lab1.rb file, add and commit those changes using git commands, then push those changes back up to GitHub.  You can review how to do this in the [GitHub Student Directory Assignment](http://127.0.0.1:4000/morea/intro/ex-using-github.html)

## Ruby Script
You will need to write this code in a ruby script file to save and run from the command shell.

The script should:

- Ask for the person's name
- Greet the player by name
- Ask for the person's age (in years)
- Tell the person how old they are in minutes (based on the years entered)
- Ask the person what the temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit
- Tell the person what the temperature is in degrees Celsius
- Thank the person by name for stopping by
