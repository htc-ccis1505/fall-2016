# {{ page.title }}
Read through Chapter 3 in the printed textbook, or Chapter 2 in the online [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_02.html), which covers how to work with strings of text in Ruby.

As you read through the text, make sure you are sitting at your computer and trying the commands in interactive ruby from the shell.  

## Notes
The examples in the text and on the web use single quotes for strings:

`puts 'Hello, World'`

It is generally considered a better practice to use double quotes for strings:
`puts "Hello, World"`

This is because you are more likely to need to use a ' in a string than a ", so using the double quotes means less need to escape characters.


## Review Questions

- What is a string?
- What is an empty string?
- Why is a string like this '   ' not an empty string?
- Why is the result of 1 + 2 not the same as '1' + '2'?
- Why is 9/4 in ruby 4 and not 4.5?  What would you need to do to get 4.5?
- What does it mean to escape a character?
