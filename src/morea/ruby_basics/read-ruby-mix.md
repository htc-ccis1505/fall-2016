# Ruby Numbers
Read through Chapter 5 in the printed textbook, or Chapter 4 in the online [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_04.html), which reviews working with numbers, strings, and variables all mixed together.

As you read through the text, make sure you are sitting at your computer and trying the commands in interactive ruby from the shell.  


## Review Questions

- How would you convert a float to an integer?
- What happens if you try to convert a string like 'hello' to an integer or a float?
- What happens if you try to convert a string like '99.9' to an integer or a float?
- What is the difference between `gets` and `chomp`?
- Can you add a number and a string?


## Try It!

- Make a program that asks for a person's first name, middle name, then last name.  Then greet the person using their full name.
- Write a program that asks for a person's favorite number.  Then add 1 to that number and suggest that back as a bigger, better favorite number.
